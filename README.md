## üìñ Module Details

### Week 1: Linear Algebra Essentials

Start your quantum journey with practical linear algebra:

```python
# Example from week1-exercises.py
import numpy as np

def create_bell_state():
    """Create a Bell state - the 'Hello World' of quantum computing."""
    ket_00 = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0])
    ket_11 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])
    bell_state = (ket_00 + ket_11) / np.sqrt(2)
    return bell_state

# Run the exercise
bell = create_bell_state()
print(f"Bell state: {bell}")
# Output: Bell state: [0.707 0. 0. 0.707]
```

## üöÄ Start Your Quantum Journey Today

Ready to dive into quantum computing? Here's your first exercise:

```python
# Your first quantum program
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer

# Create a quantum circuit with 1 qubit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)

# Put qubit in superposition
qc.h(0)

# Measure the qubit
qc.measure(0, 0)

# Run the circuit
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)

print(f"Your first quantum measurement: {counts}")
