## Appendix: Mathematical Foundations

### Quantum State Evolution for Prediction
The evolution of a quantum state |ψ(t)⟩ follows:
```
|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩ = exp(-iHt/ℏ)|ψ(0)⟩
```

For prediction, we encode time-series into |ψ(0)⟩ and evolve to extract future values.

### Quantum Kernel Definition
For feature map φ: X → H (Hilbert space):
```
K(x₁, x₂) = |⟨φ(x₁)|φ(x₂)⟩|²
```

### Variational Principle
Minimize cost function:
```
C(θ) = ∑ᵢ ||y_i - f(x_i, θ)||²
```
where f(x, θ) is quantum circuit output with parameters θ.

### Entanglement Entropy for Sequences
For bipartite state |ψ⟩_AB:
```
S(ρ_A) = -Tr(ρ_A log ρ_A)
```
where ρ_A = Tr_B(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|)

This entropy measures quantum correlations useful for sequence modeling.
